SASS Architecture: Utilizing a clear, modular file structure (e.g., 7-1 pattern) for maintainable and scalable styles.

Advanced CSS Layout: Implementing complex layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

Responsive Design: Using media queries and relative units (like rem and percentages) to ensure the site looks perfect on all devices.

CSS Animations and Transitions: Creating engaging UI/UX with smooth transitions and keyframe animations.

BEM Methodology: Applying the Block-Element-Modifier convention for clear and specific class naming.

Custom Fonts and Icons: Integrating external typography and icon libraries for a polished look.
